# Hybrid-Search-with-Google-Cloud-Vision-API
This project demonstrates a hybrid search approach combining text and image inputs using the Google Cloud Vision API and a pre-trained GPT-2 model. The system allows users to input text queries and upload images, then performs a search to find the most relevant items based on both the textual content and visual features extracted from the images.
